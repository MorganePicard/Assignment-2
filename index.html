                The New Apple Watch Measures Your Blood Oxygen. Now What?
              </h3>

              <p>
                <strong>T</strong>he new Apple Watch can be summed up in two
                words: blood oxygen. The ability to measure your blood’s oxygen
                saturation — an overall indicator of wellness — is the most
                significant new feature in the Apple Watch Series 6, which was
                unveiled this week and becomes available on Friday.
              </p>

              <p>But how useful is this feature for all of us, really?</p>

              <p>
                I wasn’t quite sure what to do with this information. So I asked
                two medical experts about the new feature. Both were cautiously
                optimistic about its potential benefits, especially for
                research. The ability to constantly monitor blood oxygen levels
                with some degree of accuracy, they said, could help people
                discover symptoms for health conditions like sleep apnea.<br />

                “Continuous recording of data can be really interesting to see
                trends,” said Cathy A. Goldstein, a sleep physician at the
                University of Michigan’s Medicine Sleep Clinic, who has
                researched data collected by Apple Watches. <br />
                It can be positive and negative,” he cautioned. “It could keep
                people out of doctors’ offices and at home and give them
                reassurance, but it could also create a lot of anxiety.” And so,
                here we are again.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="six columns">
              <p>
                If you buy the Apple Watch and have access to information about
                your blood oxygen levels all the time, it’s important to have a
                framework for thinking about the data. Most importantly, you
                should have a primary care physician with whom you can share the
                measurements so that you can place it into context with your
                overall health, like your age and pre-existing conditions, Dr.
                Goldstein said.<br />

                But when it comes to medical advice and diagnosis, always defer
                to a doctor. If you notice a big dip in your blood oxygen level,
                it is not necessarily a reason to panic, and you should talk to
                your doctor to decide whether to investigate. And if you have
                symptoms of illness, such as fever or a cough, a normal blood
                oxygen reading shouldn’t be a reason to skip talking to a
                medical professional, Dr. Goldstein said. Let a medical expert —
                not your watch — create the action plan.
              </p>

              <p>
                Blood oxygen monitoring may be more useful for people who are
                already known to have health problems, Dr. Weiss said. “If a
                patient called me and said, ‘I have Covid and my oxygen level is
                at 80 percent,’ I would say, ‘Go to the hospital,”’ Dr. Weiss
                said. <br />
                So Why Should I Care?<br />
                In the end, health data on its own isn’t immediately useful, and
                we have to decide how to make the best use of the information.
                Apple doesn’t recommend what to do or how to feel about the
                information, just as a bathroom scale doesn’t tell you you’re
                overweight and give you a diet plan.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you find that the data makes you more anxious, you could
                simply disable the feature, Dr. Goldstein said.

                  <p>
                    <strong>W</strong>hen Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos,
                    promised in 2013 that drones would soon be flying everywhere
                    delivering packages, a miniature camera whirring through
                    homes and recording video was probably not what people
                    envisioned.<br />
                    But on Thursday, Amazon’s Ring division unveiled the $249
                    Ring Always Home Cam, a small drone that hums as it flies
                    around houses filming everything, ostensibly for security
                    purposes.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Reaction to the surveillance drone was spirited — but not in
                    the way Amazon might have hoped. <br />
                    “In a country with no laws regulating digital privacy,
                    anyone who buys this from a company with a history of
                    privacy problems is insane,” tweeted Walt Mossberg, a
                    longtime tech product reviewer who is a member of the
                    nonprofit News Literacy Project’s board.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The product came to be because of technological advances and
                    consumer interest in indoor security cameras, Mr. Limp said.
                  </p>
                </div>
                
                
                <div class="four columns">
                  <p>
                    He said sensors had become good enough and cheap enough for
                    an indoor drone to operate safely. Amazon also found that
                    people did not put a camera in every room for reasons like
                    not having outlets in the right place, so the drone could
                    fill the gap, he said.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A disclaimer at the bottom of Ring’s blog post announcing
                    the drone said the device had not been authorized by the
                    Federal Communications Commission — and might not ever be
                    authorized. Ring said the drone would become available next
                    year, but not “until authorization is obtained.” Mr. Limp
                    said he expected Amazon could get approval and start
                    shipping to some people by the end of the year.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As for Mr. Bezos’ plan to have drones delivering packages?
                    Back in 2013, he said it might happen within around five
                    years. To date, it has not.

                      <p>
                        <strong>F</strong>or the last two weeks, I’ve added an
                        extra step to my bedtime routine: strapping a computer
                        around my wrist.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Would it help me to sleep better? <br />
                        I decided to test it out. I wore an Apple Watch, since
                        it is one of the most popular health-tracking devices. I
                        also downloaded a top-rated app called AutoSleep, which
                        uses the Apple Watch’s sensors to follow my movements
                        and determine when I fell asleep and woke up. (The Apple
                        Watch lacks a built-in sleep tracker.)
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        But the excitement ended there. Ultimately, the
                        technology did not help me sleep more.
                      </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="four columns">
                      <p>
                        It didn’t reveal anything that I didn’t already know.
                        And the data did not help me answer what I should do
                        about my particular sleep problems. In fact, I’ve felt
                        grumpier since I started these tests.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        For some practical tips on how to get more shut-eye, I
                        sought out Raphael Vallat, a postdoctoral researcher at
                        the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of
                        California, Berkeley. His most important advice: Do not
                        check your sleep data on a regular basis. <br />
                        “If you look at your data, it can modify the perception
                        of your sleep,” he said.
                        
                    
                        “You may think: ‘Oh, gosh, I didn’t sleep well. Should I
                        be tired? Am I in a bad mood?’”
                      
                      </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="four columns">
                      <p>
                        “You may think: ‘Oh, gosh, I didn’t sleep well. Should I
                        be tired? Am I in a bad mood?’”
                      </p>

                    
                      <p>
                        My sleep-tracking statistics said I needed more sleep.
                        (Duh.) Buried deep inside the data was some general
                        information about sleep, but the app stopped short of
                        offering advice on how to solve my personal sleep
                        problems. <br />

                        Dr. Vallat told me that if I really wanted to get better
                        sleep, I should simply try to sleep and wake up at the
                        same time every day — that would help my brain learn how
                        to build a structure for optimal sleep.<br />
                        That all sounded reasonable — and there’s no app needed
                        for any of that.
