    The New Apple Watch Measures Your Blood Oxygen. Now What?</h3>
  <div class="article-paragraph">
    <p> <strong>T</strong>he new Apple Watch can be summed up in two words: blood oxygen. The ability to measure your blood’s oxygen saturation — an overall indicator of wellness — is the most significant new feature in the Apple Watch Series 6, which was unveiled this week and becomes available on Friday
(The watch is otherwise not that different from last year’s Apple watch.
The feature is particularly timely with the coronavirus, because some patients in critical condition with Covid-19 have had low blood oxygen levels. <br>

    <p>But how useful is this feature for all of us, really?</p>
    
    <p> I had a day to test the new $399 Apple Watch to measure my blood oxygen level. The process was simple: You open the blood oxygen app on the device, keep your wrist steady and hit the Start button.
After 15 seconds, during which a sensor on the back of the watch measures your blood oxygen level by shining lights onto your wrist, it shows your reading. In three tests, my blood oxygen level stood between 99 percent and 100 percent.</p>
    
<p>I wasn’t quite sure what to do with this information. So I asked two medical experts about the new feature. Both were cautiously optimistic about its potential benefits, especially for research.
The ability to constantly monitor blood oxygen levels with some degree of accuracy, they said, could help people discover symptoms for health conditions like sleep apnea.<br>
  
“Continuous recording of data can be really interesting to see trends,” said Cathy A. Goldstein, a sleep physician at the University of Michigan’s Medicine Sleep Clinic, who has researched data collected by Apple Watches. <br>
  
But for most people who are relatively healthy, measuring blood oxygen on an everyday basis could be way more information than we need.
  Ethan Weiss, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, said he was concerned that blood oxygen readings could upset people and lead them to take unnecessary tests.</p>
  
<p>It can be positive and negative,” he cautioned.
“It could keep people out of doctors’ offices and at home and give them reassurance, but it could also create a lot of anxiety.” </p>
    <p>
      That’s important to remember as smart watches gain new health-monitoring features that give us information about ourselves that we have to figure out how to use.
When the Apple Watch Series 4 introduced an electrical heart sensor for people to take electrocardiograms in 2018, it was useful for people with known heart conditions to monitor their health
      — but doctors warned that it was also a novelty that should not be used to jump to conclusions or for people to self-diagnose heart attacks or other conditions.
    </p>

     <p>And so, here we are again.</p> 
    

    <p> What to Know About Blood Oxygen Levels </p>
<p> A healthy person will usually have blood oxygen levels in the mid- to high 90s.
When people have health conditions such as lung disease, sleep disorders or respiratory infections, levels can dip to the 60s to the low 90s, Dr. Goldstein said. <br>
    
If you buy the Apple Watch and have access to information about your blood oxygen levels all the time, it’s important to have a framework for thinking about the data.
Most importantly, you should have a primary care physician with whom you can share the measurements so that you can place it into context with your overall health, like your age and pre-existing conditions, Dr. Goldstein said.<br>
    
But when it comes to medical advice and diagnosis, always defer to a doctor. If you notice a big dip in your blood oxygen level, it is not necessarily a reason to panic, and you should talk to your doctor to decide whether to investigate.
    And if you have symptoms of illness, such as fever or a cough, a normal blood oxygen reading shouldn’t be a reason to skip talking to a medical professional, Dr. Goldstein said. </p>
    
  <p>Let a medical expert — not your watch — create the action plan.</p>
  
Blood oxygen monitoring may be more useful for people who are already known to have health problems, Dr. Weiss said.
For example, if someone with a history of heart failure saw lower saturation levels in their blood oxygen during exercise, that information could be shared with a doctor, who could then modify the treatment plan.
The information could also be used to determine whether a sick person should go to the hospital. “If a patient called me and said, ‘I have Covid and my oxygen level is at 80 percent,’ I would say, ‘Go to the hospital,”’ Dr. Weiss said. </p>

  <p> So Why Should I Care?</p>
  
<p> In the end, health data on its own isn’t immediately useful, and we have to decide how to make the best use of the information.
  Apple doesn’t recommend what to do or how to feel about the information, just as a bathroom scale doesn’t tell you you’re overweight and give you a diet plan. </p>
    
<p> If you find that the data makes you more anxious, you could simply disable the feature, Dr. Goldstein said.</p>
  
<p> But even if blood oxygen measurement sounds gimmicky today, it’s important to keep an open mind about how new health-monitoring technologies might benefit us in the future.
  Both Dr. Goldstein and Dr. Weiss pointed to sleep apnea as an area where wearable computers might benefit people. The condition, which causes breathing problems during sleep, affects millions of Americans, but most people never know that they have it.</p>

<p>It’s a bit of a catch-22. <br>
If you had symptoms of sleep apnea, which include lower blood oxygen levels, your doctor would order a test.
But you probably wouldn’t catch the symptoms while you were asleep, so a study would never be ordered.</p>
  
<p> The Apple watch will periodically measure your blood oxygen level in the background, including when you are asleep.<br>
  So if we gather data about ourselves while we’re slumbering, we might discover something unknown about ourselves — or not.</p>
<p>“Until we start doing it, we don’t know whether or not this information can be valuable,” Dr. Goldstein said. </p>

    Amazon Unveils Drone That Films Inside Your Home. What Could Go Wrong?
  </h3>
  <div class="article 2">
    <p>
<strong>W</strong>hen Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, promised in 2013 that drones would soon be flying everywhere delivering packages, a miniature camera whirring through homes and recording video was probably not what people envisioned.</p>
    
<p> But on Thursday, Amazon’s Ring division unveiled the $249 Ring Always Home Cam, a small drone that hums as it flies around houses filming everything, ostensibly for security purposes.</p>

<p>Amazon also introduced new Echo devices, a cloud gaming service called Luna and other products. But the home security drone stood out.
      The company’s promotional video highlighting the camera showed a burglar breaking into a home and getting spooked as the drone flew straight at him — “Oh, no!” he exclaimed — while the homeowner watched the encounter on his phone.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” the ad proclaimed.</p>
    
<p> Reaction to the surveillance drone was spirited — but not in the way Amazon might have hoped. </p>
    
<p> “In a country with no laws regulating digital privacy, anyone who buys this from a company with a history of privacy problems is insane,”
  tweeted Walt Mossberg, a longtime tech product reviewer who is a member of the nonprofit News Literacy Project’s board.</p>
<p> Ring said the drone could be used to check whether a homeowner had left the stove on or a window open, and promised that it would record only while flying.
  It would also make a humming sound so it would be clear when it was filming. But privacy was still the primary concern for most flabbergasted Twitter users. <br>
  “An internet connected drone camera for your home, owned by Amazon. this definitely won’t be a privacy nightmare *at all*” one person tweeted.
  “A scary step in the future of tech?” posted another Twitter user, Khoa Phan. “Like it’s cool but always eerie at the same time. Obviously there’s some concerns about privacy with Amazon. But what’s the next step after this if this is just the beginning!?” </p>
    <p>
      Dave Limp, the executive responsible for Amazon’s devices, said it had made major investments in camera security, such as two-factor authentication and end-to-end encryption, that will roll out this year.
      “If Walt doesn’t want to buy this drone, then fine,” he said.</p>
     <p> The product came to be because of technological advances and consumer interest in indoor security cameras, Mr. Limp said.
      He said sensors had become good enough and cheap enough for an indoor drone to operate safely.
      Amazon also found that people did not put a camera in every room for reasons like not having outlets in the right place, so the drone could fill the gap, he said.</p>
      <p> A disclaimer at the bottom of Ring’s blog post announcing the drone said the device had not been authorized by the Federal Communications Commission — and might not ever be authorized.
      Ring said the drone would become available next year, but not “until authorization is obtained.” Mr. Limp said he expected Amazon could get approval and start shipping to some people by the end of the year. </p>
    
    <p> As for Mr. Bezos’ plan to have drones delivering packages? Back in 2013, he said it might happen within around five years. To date, it has not.

  <h3>
    The Sad Truth About Sleep-Tracking Devices and Apps
  </h3>
  <div class="article 3">
    <p><strong>F</strong>or the last two weeks, I’ve added an extra step to my bedtime routine: strapping a computer around my wrist.<br>
      The new nightly move was prompted by a cascade of wearable gadgets from companies like Fitbit and Apple, which claim that their sensor-laden bracelets and watches can improve our lives by helping us detect health problems so that we can come up with solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years, fitness gadgets have measured basic data, like footsteps or calories burned, to motivate us to stay active or shed pounds.
      Sleep tracking is still a nascent area that tech companies are experimenting with — one that I’ve watched with interest as someone who has been sleep deprived for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past, I’ve tried several gadgets with sleep tech, including Fitbit watches and Bose’s sleep-aid earbuds.
      But I hadn’t consistently tracked my sleep habits and patterns before.
      Would it really make a difference, I wondered, to have this data? Would it help me to sleep better?
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to test it out. I wore an Apple Watch, since it is one of the most popular health-tracking devices. I also downloaded a top-rated app called AutoSleep,
      which uses the Apple Watch’s sensors to follow my movements and determine when I fell asleep and woke up.
      (The Apple Watch lacks a built-in sleep tracker.) Here’s what AutoSleep gathered on my sleep habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the excitement ended there. Ultimately, the technology did not help me sleep more.
      It didn’t reveal anything that I didn’t already know, which is that I average about five and a half hours of slumber a night.
      And the data did not help me answer what I should do about my particular sleep problems.
      In fact, I’ve felt grumpier since I started these tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      That mirrored the conclusions of a recent study from Rush University Medical College and Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.
      Researchers there noticed patients complaining about sleep data collected by apps and devices from Nike, Apple, Fitbit and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their study, the researchers warned that sleep-tracking tech could provide inaccurate data and worsen insomnia by making people obsessed with achieving perfect slumber,
      a condition they called orthosomnia.
      It was one of the latest pieces of research supporting the idea that health apps don’t necessarily make people healthier.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some practical tips on how to get more shut-eye, I sought out Raphael Vallat, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley.
      His most important advice: Do not check your sleep data on a regular basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you look at your data, it can modify the perception of your sleep,” he said.
      “You may think: ‘Oh, gosh, I didn’t sleep well. Should I be tired? Am I in a bad mood?’”
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s what I learned after two weeks of sleep tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      How sleep cycles work
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand sleep-tracking data, I delved into how sleep works.
      There are three main stages: Light sleep, deep sleep and REM sleep (for rapid eye movement).
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep sleep stage is beneficial for physical restoration, like muscle reparation and metabolism recovery, researchers said.
      REM sleep, the stage in which we dream, helps in repairing our psychological and emotional networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On average, a person completes a sleep cycle, which includes each of the three main stages, every 90 minutes.
      To get a good night’s sleep, you need to complete four or five cycles.
      That’s partly because the cycles are not the same throughout the night: The early cycles have more deep sleep, whereas the later ones have more REM sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But our sleep-tracking tech? It generally can’t accurately measure REM sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sleep-tracking labs, the gold-standard scientific equipment typically includes sensors that are connected to someone’s face and neck to measure eye and brain activity, among other variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sleep-tracking apps for wearable devices like the Apple Watch or Fitbit primarily look at movement and heart rate to determine when you are asleep or awake — which are generally not precise enough to measure the different sleep stages, Dr. Vallat said.
      Without a good look at REM sleep, those apps may give an incomplete picture of sleep quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is where the AutoSleep app gets credit: It estimates sleep duration and deep sleep using the motion and heart rate sensors, but it does not attempt to guess REM sleep.
      David Walsh, the computer scientist who developed AutoSleep, said he knew the movement and heart rate sensors would not accurately estimate the REM stage, so he didn’t bother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another unknown for sleep trackers are the algorithms that are being used to measure people’s sleep, Dr. Vallat said.
      In contrast, the algorithms used by university sleep labs have been publicly shared for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some scientists said consumer-grade sleep trackers should not be dismissed as inaccurate.
      Michael Grandner, director of the University of Arizona’s sleep research program, who has consulted for Fitbit, said that wrist-worn sleep trackers had a long history of use in scientific research and that some devices could be very accurate at measuring sleep stages.
      He added that the devices enabled some sleep tracking to be done in the real world, not a lab.
    </p>
    <p>
      What to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      O.K., but what happens once you collect your sleep data from a tracker or an app? There is no real answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sleep-tracking statistics said I needed more sleep. (Duh.)
      Buried deep inside the data was some general information about sleep, but the app stopped short of offering advice on how to solve my personal sleep problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ethan Weiss, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, has been wearing a ring on his finger called Oura Ring, which includes a sleep tracker, for nearly a year.
      The ring measures motion and heart rate to present granular data about the different sleep stages.
      He said that while the device most likely had a rough sense of when he was sleeping and awake, he didn’t know whether the information about sleep stages was accurate — let alone what to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There’s no program — it’s just information,” Dr. Weiss said.
      “The question is can you do anything on your own to optimize it?
      Or is the information just worthless or is it making things worse?
      Sometimes being aware of it just makes you even more anxious.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Vallat shared similar concerns.
      One big problem, he said, is that many of these tracking apps send daily notifications with users’ sleep statistics.
      He suggested that people experimenting with sleep trackers look at weekly trends, not daily summaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a vicious cycle, because if you immediately feel you didn’t sleep enough, it will impact your mood,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Grandner of the University of Arizona said that consumer-grade sleep tracking was in its early stages and that it was too soon to tell what people should do with the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For a person to be worrying about their sleep stages is like being worried about the gas makeup of the air you’re breathing in,” he said.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Where that leaves us
    </p>
    <p>
      Makers of sleep tech and scientists can agree on one thing: Sleep-tracking apps and devices can be useful for getting a broad look at your sleep,
      but people should resist drawing conclusions about their sleep health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Walsh, the developer of AutoSleep, said people should use his app to look at trends, not to obsess over the daily data.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ve had plenty of customers say this has changed their life, but I get other people saying they’re waking up in the middle of the night and checking their sleep,” he said. “I tell them to go back to sleep.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitbit said in a statement that it took accuracy very seriously and that its team continuously studied and tested the accuracy of its products.
      Apple did not immediately have a comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Vallat told me that if I really wanted to get better sleep, I should simply try to sleep and wake up at the same time every day — that would help my brain learn how to build a structure for optimal sleep.
      He also advised making the bedroom a cool environment (about 68 degrees) and as dark as possible; avoiding alcohol in the evening;
      not checking email or social media right before bed; and asking myself each morning when I woke up, “Do I feel refreshed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      That all sounded reasonable — and there’s no app needed for any of that.
    </p>
